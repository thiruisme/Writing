Opening paragraph — set up the topic with personal context or a broad observation.

Middle paragraphs — develop the idea with personal anecdotes, examples, and reflections.

<blockquote class="pullquote">
A key sentence from the post that captures the central idea.
</blockquote>

Continue developing the theme with more depth, examples, or a shift in perspective.

Closing paragraph — tie the theme together with a reflective takeaway. End warmly and personally.
